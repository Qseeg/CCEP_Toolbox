# CCEP Toolbox
*CCEP*: Cortico-cortical Evoked Potentials.   
*SPES*: Single Pulse Electrical Stimulation.

This software is designed to help epilepsy researchers and clinicians working with Stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) patient data better to organise and view the results of SPES and CCEP studies.

This program is for clinical research purposes only, and no clinical decisions should be made based on its results.

- Validate planned stimulation parameters against recommended safety constraints.
- Localize electrodes: co-register CT and MRI images, or pre- and post- implantation MRI; visualize electrode locations.

- View SEEG recordings, re-reference montage, filter and annotate.
- Acquire stimulus pulse times automatically from a trigger channel, or define manually.
